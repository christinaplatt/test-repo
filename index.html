		Hello world, the Journey from Wawa manager, to Bank Teller, to Web Developer
	</h2>
	<p>For nine years, I worked for Wawa. What can i say, I loved it. I loved the people, both customers and employees. I never complained(much) about working late or pulling doubles, but after nine years I decided to make a change! A position opened up at a local bank, and I decided to go for it! I was excited to work in a professional enviroment and learn new and different things. After a few months with the bank, I was coming to the realization that I didn't like it very much. I wanted something more, I wanted to be challenged everyday and to learn new things.</p>
	<p>
		I decided to be a Web Developer. more about nycda and my path to be a developer.
